%help
    The purpose of this container is to re-create an environment that is as close to the Helix as possible without the headache of missing and/or incompatible core dependencies.
    Contains a substantial amount of development software and libraries required for developing and compiling C and Python3 programs.
    Added EPEL and SCL repos for HTSlib and GCC8. Disabled HTTPS epel repo since now blocked by the company firewall.
